# NewRelic.org Donor Analyzer

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-donor-analyzer/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-donor-analyzer?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-donor-analyzer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-donor-analyzer)

## Usage
Donor Analyzer connects your siteâ€™s performance with its impact on donations.  Using metrics like `Bounce Rate` and session thresholds like `Satisfied`, `Tolerated`, and `Frustrated`, the app displays how much giving is at risk for a given time period.

Donor Analyzer uses the `PageView` and `Browser Interaction`events in New Relic to interrogate and categorize the performance of a website and associated sessions for a user-determined timeslice. You can explore the performance of individual pages and forecast how improving performance impacts KPIs like `Bounce Rate`, traffic, and now, giving. This analysis is based on moving individual browsing sessions from `Tolerated` and `Frustrated` into `Satisfied` (as defined by the [`apdex`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) value for a given New Relic donor application).

### Impacted Donors
![Impacted Donor Details](catalog/screenshots/nr1-donor-analyzer-02.png)
 - This table shows individual session data for sessions in the selected timeslice that are marked as `Frustrated`.
 - Each session represents an indivdual donor experience on your website.
 - You can configure an associated `CRM ID` to identify indvidual donors in real time.
 - Sort columns by accending or decending order.

### Frustrated Giving
Frustrated Giving shows the estimated dollar value of giving that is put at risk through sessions marked as frusterated in the following formula.

Number of `Frustrated` sessions * `Average Donation` * `Bounce Rate` = `Furstrated Giving`.


### Configuration and Setup
The Donor Analyzer can be set up to consume a unique CRM ID passed as a custom attribute through the [`Browser Agent`](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/set-custom-attribute). You can then configure which attribute to display in the Impacted Donor table using the Edit Settings gear under the Frustrated Giving Section.

#### Average Donation
Edit the Average Donation amount by clicking **Edit Settings**. This number is designed to represent the value of the average giving transaction on your website.

#### CRM Link Support
Donor Analyzer supports linking your custom CRM attribute to your unique CRM instance. When configured, it turns the cofigured CRM attribute into a live link to the donor's CRM profile.

In settings, select either Salesforce or HubSpot CRM. Once this is set, your organization name can be keyed into the CRM URL path.
